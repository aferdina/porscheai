# Reinforcement Learning for self-driving cars

Welcome to the README guide for training an autonomous driving agent using reinforcement learning! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to train an AI agent capable of driving a car in a simulated environment using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Introduction

Autonomous driving is a challenging task that involves training an agent to navigate complex road environments while adhering to traffic rules and ensuring passenger safety. Reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to address this problem by enabling the agent to learn from its interactions with the environment and make decisions that maximize a cumulative reward signal.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.10.4
- Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., gymnasium, PyTorch)

## Setup

1. Install pyenv and as described [here](https://github.com/aferdina/IntroductionRL/blob/main/01_Firststeps.md) and [here](https://github.com/aferdina/IntroductionRL/blob/main/03_Codingguidelines.md)
2. Install python 3.10.4 by using

    ```sh
    pyenv install 3.10.0
    ```

3. Install Dependencies: Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

## Training Process

1. **State Space Definition:** Define the state representation of the environment. This could include information about the car's position, velocity, surroundings, etc.

2. **Action Space Definition:** Specify the possible actions the agent can take, such as accelerating, braking, and steering.

3. **Reward Function:** Design a reward function that provides feedback to the agent based on its actions. Rewards should encourage safe driving behavior and progress towards the destination.

4. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO, A3C) that suits your problem. Implement the algorithm using your chosen RL library.

5. Training Loop: Set up the training loop where the agent interacts with the environment, selects actions, receives rewards, and updates its policy based on the chosen algorithm.

## Evaluation

1. **Testing:** After training the agent, evaluate its performance on a test set of scenarios. Observe how well it adheres to traffic rules, navigates complex intersections, and responds to dynamic environments.

2. **Metrics:** Define evaluation metrics such as average reward, collision rate, distance traveled, etc., to quantify the agent's performance.

## Fine-Tuning and Experimentation

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) to improve the agent's training speed and performance.

Model Architecture: Explore different neural network architectures for the agent's policy and value functions.

Reward Shaping: Refine the reward function to guide the agent towards desired behaviors more effectively.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully trained an autonomous driving agent using reinforcement learning. The agent should now be capable of navigating the environment based on its learned policy.
